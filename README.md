# AI-enabled-HTE-Li-Production


## About the Project
This repository hosts the scripts and AI-driven tools developed as part of our innovative study on lithium brine softening. Our research introduces an AI-enabled, active learning high-throughput method that integrates carbon dioxide (CO2(g)) capture into the conversion of lithium chloride (LiCl) to lithium carbonate (Li2CO3). This approach not only streamlines the production process but also enhances the sustainability of battery manufacturing by significantly reducing carbon emissions. The materials within include the developed machine learning models, data, and key findings that underline our advancements in efficient and eco-friendly battery material production.



## Key Highlights
Utilization of CO2(g) in the lithium softening reaction.

Active learning-driven high-throughput experimentation methodology.

Focus on elemental concentrations of carbon, nitrogen, and lithium for process optimization.
Enhanced sustainability in battery-grade lithium production.
